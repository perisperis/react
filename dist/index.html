    <h3 style="color: rgb(0,102,161);">What is your line of work? Why did you join the technology business in the first place? What motivated you?</h3>
<p>I work as a Solution Architect for Worldline Iberia. We create 
solution strategies to update Legacy Applications to Cloud Computing 
Architectures and from waterfall methodologies to DevOps.</p>
<p>I joined the technology business because it is still fun and 
enjoyable (I love coding). I also like the fact that its culture is one 
where people regularly thank each other and express gratitude to their 
co-workers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, technology is everywhere and I wanted to be part of that 
wave. Indeed, working in the technology business provides opportunities 
to innovate, to grow and to have new challenges, as well as the 
possibility to work with talented people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0,102,161);">What do you find more challenging in your profession?</h3>
<p>I would say that adapting to the&nbsp;transformation of payments, and
 to the innovations around it, can be considered as challenging. In 
addition, being compliant with security requirements and regulations, 
and adapting to cultural changes, can also be challenging</p>
<p>Finally, what I consider maybe as my biggest challenge is being an 
advocate of change towards people who have been working for more than 20
 years with the same systems using the same methodologies. Indeed, old 
habits tend to die hard!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0,102,161);">What are you most proud of in your work?</h3>
<p>I am proud of many aspects of my work at Worldline but the one that 
matters the most to me is the moment when the products you have put a 
lot of efforts into go live and impact many people. It provides a great 
sense of accomplishment and a great sense of pride. One concrete example
 of that is enabling Japanese tourists to pay with their credit cards in
 Belgium thanks to the work of our team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0,102,161);">What advices would you give to achieve work-life balance?</h3>
<p>In order to achieve work-life balance, I think you must manage your 
time (if you cannot do it by yourself, I suggest getting help from a 
personal coach), make time for your family (enjoying weekends and 
vacations), take time for yourself (read more, exercise) and manage your
 work hours (set achievable working hours).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0,102,161);">How has Worldline helped you to advance in your career and reach your professional goals?</h3>
<p>First, Worldline gave me the opportunity to develop an international 
career 8 years ago. Then, Worldline enabled me to work in many different
 domains around payments with highly qualified people, in multi-cultural
 teams, in a happy workforce, promoting a lot of internal initiatives ….
 And by mainly showing respect, trust and admiration for my 
work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
